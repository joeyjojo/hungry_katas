Sky Net
======================

The objective is to build a terminator api which people who work at sky net can use

A terminator has 2 commands, kill and defend
These commands take a target
These should be able to be chained together
e.g. terminator.kill(person_one).kill(person_two).defend(person_three)

If a terminator is attacking a terminator who is being defended then they must also kill the defender

Humans can not attack, they can only die

Optional Extra For Quick People
===============================

The target and terminators should be able to defend themselves from an attack with a chance of winning

Optional Extra For Really Quick People
===============================

The target does not have to be human, it could be an item or a place
e.g. terminator.defend(house) and terminator.kill(tank)

Notes
======================

For the person who is running the session I find that it is sometimes good to make it a competition

Everyone starts at 0 points
Every time someone can evidence they have used a pattern they get 1 point
If they can convince people that it was the best constructor to use they get 10
If no constructor patterns were used then then loose 10 points

Don't forget to put aside some time to let teams talk about how they can apply this to their code currently or how they feel about the techniques
