Primitive Obsession Kata
======================

Definition
======================

Primitive Obsession is using primitive data types to represent domain ideas
For example, we use a String to represent a message, an Integer to represent an amount of money, or a plain json object to represent a specific object

see http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrimitiveObsession for more details

Kata
======================

1. If you add a any 'primitive' as a parameter/variable extract to a new prototype
2. If you create a json object/array extract this to a new prototype and add methods such as getItem/addItem
3. If you override any part of the prototype or extend without changing the prototype... change the prototype
