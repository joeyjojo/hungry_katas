Primitive Obsession Kata
======================

1. If you add a any 'primitive' as a parameter/variable extract to a new prototype
2. If you create a json object/array extract this to a new prototype and add methods such as getItem/addItem
3. If you override any part of the prototype or extend without changing the prototype... change the prototype
